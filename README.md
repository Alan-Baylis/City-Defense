# City-Defense
The focus of this project was in developing game systems such as combat, user interface, menus, and a wave-based spawner for enemies. All art assets were obtained through the Unity store. 

In order to comply with the Unity Store Asset Store agreement, any non-original assets have been removed from the repository.
